# Medium Rare

A WordPress theme based on Readium (http://github.com/rewdy/readium) which is inspired by Medium.com.

More super-cool information coming soon. Still in development, *please do not deploy until this is updated*.

## Features (list pulled from Readium description, will be updated soon to reflect updates)

- Site-wide header image support
- Per post feature image that displays at the top of the page like the header image (replacing the header image when set)
- *Resources* custom post type that provides the ability to post links to books, music, services, etc. The listing page shows in a staggered grid kind of like Pinterest.
- Custom header image for the resources listing page (yoururl.com/resources)
- Responsive design with "drawer" for main menu and widgets
- Footer widget area and footer menu area

## Notes on Using

This theme has been customized to be used on a specific site. While the header image can be customized using the WP Customize settings, the colors must be changed in the css/style.less file (then the stylesheet would need to be recompiled.) Therefore, if you want to use this theme, you'll probably want to branch it and make you changes.
